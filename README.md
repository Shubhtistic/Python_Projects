# Python Learning Portfolio üêç

This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of my work and progress as I advance my skills in the Python programming language. It contains a collection of standalone projects, each designed to master specific, industry-relevant concepts.

My approach is to build a strong foundation in core Python‚Äîincluding Object-Oriented Programming, data structures, and file I/O‚Äîbefore progressing to more advanced backend and data-focused technologies.

## Repository Structure

This is a monorepo that houses several individual projects. Each project resides in its own dedicated folder and is a self-contained application with its own:
* Virtual environment (`.venv`) for isolated dependency management.
* `requirements.txt` file listing its specific packages.
* Detailed `README.md` explaining its purpose, features, and setup instructions.

## Learning Focus

The projects within this repository are exercises in mastering a wide range of skills, including but not limited to:

* **Core Python:** Object-Oriented design, data structures, and standard library modules.
* **Application Architecture:** Building robust, multi-file applications with a clean separation of concerns.
* **External Libraries:** Integrating and using popular third-party packages for tasks like CLI design (`rich`) and API interaction (`deep-translator`).
* **Professional Tooling:** Following best practices for dependency management, version control, and project structure.

Feel free to explore the individual project folders to see my work.
